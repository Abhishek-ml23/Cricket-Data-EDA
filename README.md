# 🏏 Cricket Data EDA

A Cricket Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project that explores trends, patterns, and insights from a cricket dataset (likely related to Indian Premier League or similar match data). This project uses Python and common data science libraries to analyze and visualize cricket statistics.

📌 Project Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on cricket data to uncover interesting insights and patterns related to matches, players, teams, scores, and other statistics. EDA helps understand the shape of the data, find trends, visualize distributions, and answer data-driven questions before any predictive modeling.

Common goals in cricket EDA projects include:

🏆 Top teams and player performance

📅 Trends over seasons and match outcomes

🧮 Run and wicket distributions

📊 Venue or season-wise analysis

🎯 Player contributions and records

🛠️ How to Use
1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Abhishek-ml23/Cricket-Data-EDA.git
cd Cricket-Data-EDA

2. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Python installed, then install required packages:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn notebook

3. Open and Run the Notebook

Launch the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook assignment_code.ipynb


Explore the analysis step-by-step, including data cleaning, visualization, and interpretation.

📊 What You’ll Learn

This project demonstrates key concepts in data analysis:

✔ Loading and inspecting datasets
✔ Handling missing values and formatting data
✔ Data visualization (histograms, bar charts, scatter plots)
✔ Grouping and aggregating cricket statistics
✔ Drawing insights from visual patterns and metrics

🔍 Example Insights (Typical in Cricket EDA)

Although your dataset may vary, common exploratory questions include:

What teams have the most wins?

Which players score the most runs?

How does performance change by venue?

What is the distribution of match scores?

Are toss winners more likely to win matches?

(Replace or expand these based on your actual assignment_code.ipynb analysis.)
